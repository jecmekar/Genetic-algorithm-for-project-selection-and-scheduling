# Genetic-algorithm-for-project-selection-and-scheduling
Proposed GA and LP model codes and experimental results for article in Mathematics journal. 

There are 5 files, consisting of 2 computational scripts in Jupyter notebook and 3 excel files with computational results. 

Jupyter notebook file:
Genetic_algorithm.ipynb - computational script with input data of the problem adressed and genetic algorithm to solve it; 
LP_model.ipynb - computational script with the linear programming model in PuLP to solve the adressed problem, the computational time is limited to 1 hour.

Excel files:
Results_calibration.xlsx - this file contains calibration results - 480 runs of the proposed GA with different GA parameters settings;
Results_operator_time.xlsx - this file contains results from post-computational analysis with computational time of GA evaluation and operators;
